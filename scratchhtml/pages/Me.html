<!--The site must include a resume portion created in html (not as a pdf).
This should be a useful resume with good information organized in an easy-to-access way.
Useful information includes your education, work experience, skills, and possibly some awards or honors that distinguish you.
You do not need to include your contact information unless you want to.-->
